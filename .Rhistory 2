## R Markdown
Much of the work in this class will be done via R Markdown documents. R Markdown documents combine text (with easy formatting opens including typesetting equations), R code, and R output including figures. They are a great way to produce self-contained, reprodudicble, well-documented statistical analyses
In this first .Rmd worksheet, you will learn how to do some basic markdown editing. After you have made changes to the document, press "Knit HTML" in R Studio and see what results you get (it will complain if you do something wrong; troubleshooting is part of life)!
