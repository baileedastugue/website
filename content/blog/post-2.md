Project 2: Modeling and Predicting Cardiovascular Disease

The R markdown file can be found [here](/Project2)

For some reason, there is an extreme over-representation of Dr. Manhattan's cardiovascular system. Is this because he is able to reconstruct himself to a size where his heart stucture is more clearly discernable? Has his contributions to modern understanding of anatomy and physiology been overlooked? Dr. Manhattan aside, why is the cardiovascular system so frequently represented on a blue body, when blue is most typically associated with dexoygenated blood? These questions, of course, have nothing to do with using RStudio to predict disease, but they should still be answered.
