I am again situated at this point of uncertainty in my future. For most of my early college years (2013-2015), I went through the motions of receiving a business education without enthusiasm or direction. The only classes to pique my interest were a biology for non-majors course and marketing research. Since turning down the road to pre-med in 2016, my love for learning returned aaaaand so did my chronic pain. I do not know what career options would fulfill me both personally and professionally and I do not, as of December 23rd @ 11:56am, know what surgeries I will eventually need and what that recovery will look like.

So for now, I will focus on what I am certain of.

*Current abnormalities:*
- Severe pain in my left hip, similar to the pain I previously experienced in the right. Will find out whether a labrum tear is present / if I need another PAO within the week after my MRI this afternoon.
- Heterotrophic ossification on the right hip with tenderness and pain. To revise this growth, my recovery would start at 0. To opt out of surgery risks further muscle atrophy and weakness. Neither feels like a great option.
- Inability to lift my right leg, potentially due to HO impairing the nerve connection. 

*Current considerations:*
- Cannot sit or stand for any extended period of time - does not bode well for any normal job opportunities
- Need to take one more lab to complete my B.S.
- Need to take 7 hours to keep insurance
- Physical therapy 3x a week (formal)
- With no grasp on future surgeries, in-person classes do not seem like an option - reconsider this after MRI results

*Things I like to do:*
- Learn -- specifically about science, statistics, the human body, and programming
- Spread information and lower the barrier to entry in understanding complex ideas
- Make study guides / visual representations of information
- Knit, embroider
- Spend an absurd amount of time alone

*Things of greatest importance:*
- Time with my husband, our future wolves, and our families
- Recovery, reduction of pain
- Maintaining health + balance in other areas, including keeping my brain stimulated so it doesn't atrophy with the rest of me

And with these thoughts externalized from my hamster wheel, I return to learning responsive web programming basic.
