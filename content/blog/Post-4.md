When I was younger, I was genuinely obsessed with the Harry Potter series. Not in the "I've been to all of the midnight-book releases" or the "I have a Deathly Hallows tattoo on my forearm" way. But in a more trait-revealing way. As an adult, I see the seeds of an obsessive personality, hyper-focused on details, puzzles, and patterns, sown through these novels. I read books ON these books - dozens of them. I learned the latin roots for spells and character names and eventually tried to teach myself French because I somehow came across a French-to-English Harry Potter dictionary. Whatever that means. On a family trip to Europe in 2007, days after the final "Hallows" release and my first time really ever leaving the country, I bought the seventh book while in London. I had heard, through whatever grapevine of HP weirdos a 12-year old could be part of, that there were differences in the text between the American English and British English and was determined to find them. Spoiler: they were mostly different spellings and my parents ended up locking my books in the trunk of the car so I could "enjoy the English countryside." Why my parents decided that that moment, after years of fostering this obsession, was over the line of normalcy? I'll never know. 

My initial idea for this project was to compare the first chapter of the Americanized "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" series to the original, UK "Philospher's Stone" version, using both R and Python code. The goal would be to count how many times each word was used and then compare differences. It's so much more tech-savvy than me highlighting potential deviations in the back of a small rental car with the rest of my family to compare at a later time. However, my efforts were thwarted by not having free access to distinctly different text. Instead, I'll eventually compare the connotations of each first chapter using a positive or negative lexicon found here[].
