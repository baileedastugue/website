My name is Bailee Dastugue (formerly Wallis). 

Any ‘about me’ is typically hyper-focused on an all-too revealing medical history. Whether it is because that is what my life has actually consisted of or because it’s what I, personally, find most interesting is beyond me. My bias towards biology pervades my biography. Above all, I’m interested in the human body – why it functions, why it fails, and how we can systemically improve our human condition through science, statistics, and rational thought.

I am fortunate enough to be surrounded by love (re: husband, Jack, and feline offspring, Bellatrix), science, and Austin, Texas. 

##### Business to Biology

As of fall 2019, I’m at a total of 6 surgeries with a handful more likely to come. These procedures are heavily intertwined with Why I’m Here: why I began a pursuit of an MD with one semester left in a business degree and why I eventually left said pursuit in the middle of interviewing at medical schools. My current trajectory is hurdling towards graduating (again!) in the Spring of 2020 with a B.S. in Human Biology and a very large question mark after that. My desire is to imbue a love of learning in students, particularly pre-health individuals, at the higher-education level - we will see what this broken bod lets me do beyond more surgery.

##### Education

BBA in Marketing from the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Spring 2016

BS in Human Biology with a Pre-health Certificate for Science Majors from the University of Texas at Austin, Spring 2020
