Our story beings on a Sunday afternoonsJust between Halfway Tree and Spanish TownWhere a young boy, not yet the cock of the walkHe would soon become, was lying on the grassAnd taking in the sweet and sensuous scent of HibiscusThat languidly lilted along the summer breezeIt was at this precise moment that he saw herHer walk was soft and delicateWith a thaumaturgical touch that only a Rabbi's daughter could haveBefore their eyes had even metHer luminous lips had already lured him inSalvation winked with the promise of a Bris held at pinnacleAnd a congregation of sages bunny hopping and chicken dancing to Yiddish MentoThen their eyes linked, an eon blinkedAmharic vows were screed upon their heartsJust to think, this could all be with the frenectomy and a few words of loveMy Shabop Shalom babyWon't you Shabop Shalom with meUnder the old banana tree?My sweet Telavivian lambs breadMy heart can act as an emollientAnd you'll never, ever say, "Get bent", no, no, ohTodamamatodamamaTodamamatodamama, da, da, da, daTodamamatodamamaTodamamatodamama, da, da, da, daAll the signals that I'm sendingI'll keep sending them and on the constanttillionth timeI'll make you mine(Yes, I swear I will)Your sweet supple breasts are golden ghettosSoft statues in stilettosTwo wise men instead of threeWhen I'm in a foul moodI gotta' see you in your TalmudAnd so happy it makes meYou wanna know who, who wrote the Book of Job?She wants to knowWho, who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls?Well, I did, I didYes, yes, I did, I didI did, I did, I did, I didHexakosioihexekontahexaphobiaCan be a fun ordealI swear by Solomon's sealHoney, when it comes to loveThere's a fire in the deep end of my heartGiving me the Heebie-JeebiesYou see, I know the land of wood and watersMerely fodder for loves slaughterAnd darling, I've watched you cake-walkTo the immaculate conception for far too longI'm livicated to you, yesAhava Raba, Ahava Raba for youWe're in Heaven, we're in Heaven, it's trueI'm ascending, I'm ascending tonight with you
