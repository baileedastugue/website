Any ‘about me’ is typically hyper-focused on an all-too revealing medical history. Whether it is because that is what my life has actually consisted of or because it’s what I, personally, find most interesting is beyond me. My bias towards biology pervades my biography. 

As of fall 2019, I’m at a total of 6 surgeries, looking down the barrel of at least one additional procedure. These events are heavily intertwined with Why I’m Here: why I began a pursuit of an MD with one semester left in a business degree and why I eventually left said pursuit in the middle of interviewing at medical schools. My current trajectory is hurdling towards graduating (again!) in the Spring of 2020 with a doctorate in exercise physiology to follow. I’m interested in the human body – why it fails, why it functions, and how we can systemically improve our human condition.
